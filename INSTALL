# Installation

For reproducing our results, we provide a docker container containing scripts for the installation, alternatively, we also provide a description for a [manual setup](#manual-setup) showing the steps to perform on a Linux-based operating system to repoduce the results of this work.

## Setup via Dockerfile

To ease the installation of our tool, we provide a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for setting up a docker container.
Please note that the container will use up to 1 GB of disc storage after the setup is performed.

To apply this file, we rely on docker and refer to the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) on how to install docker on your Linux operating system.

After docker is installed, make sure that the docker daemon is running. On systemd, you can use ```systemctl status docker``` to check the status of the daemon and ```sudo systemctl start docker``` to start the daemon, if necessary.

Next, download the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).
The container is set up by invoking ```sudo docker build -t twins ./``` in the directory where the Dockerfile is located.
By invoking this script, all dependencies as described in Section [Manual Setup](#manual-setup) are installed, which might take several minutes.

After setting up the docker container, all required ressources (i.e., packages, programs, and scripts) are installed and can now be used inside the container.
To begin an interactive session, the command ```sudo docker run -i -t twins /bin/bash``` can be used.
After starting the interactive session, you can continue [here](#usage).

## Manual Setup

Requirements:
  * Operating system: Ubuntu
  * git (for cloning the required repositories)
  * Python3 and Pip (on Ubuntu: python3-pip)

### Data

To clone the repository containing the data (variability models, measured performance values, and predicted performance values), use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/AI-4-SE/TwinsOrFalseFriends.git
cd TwinsOrFalseFriends
```

### Python Packages

To install the python packages needed to execute the python scripts, you can install the dependencies from ```requirements.txt``` in the top folder of the repository by executing

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
